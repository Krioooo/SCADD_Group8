## **Important Note**
1. This repo is designed with separate folders and files for code and dependencies. Below is a detailed breakdown of the structure:

(1)**`coursework.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing comments, visualizations, results for the coursework.

(2)**`utils/`**: Utility scripts used for various coursework exercises:
- **`exercises1_1.py`**: Provides functions for exercises1.1.
- **`exercises1_2.py`**: Provides functions for exercises1.2.
- **`exercises2_1.py, exercises3_1.py, exercises4_1.py, exercises5_1.py`**: Same as exercises1_1.py and exercises1_2.py

2. Reproduce any output (graph/ table)

(1) For the graphs in exercises1.2 and exercises2.1, in order to reproduce the graph, we have set up a random seed to generate a fixed Brownian motion term.

(2) For the graphs in exercise3, exercise4, exercise5, due to the use of reinforcement learning, the randomness is so high that the graph generated by code is different each time. Therefore, running the code cannot obtain the same result.
